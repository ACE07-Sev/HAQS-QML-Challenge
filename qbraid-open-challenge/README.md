# qBraid Open Challenge

In this open challenge, submissions will be judged on the most creative/compelling use of the [qBraid-SDK](https://qbraid-qbraid.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/sdk/overview.html). The only additional requirement is that you must in some way use [qBraid quantum jobs](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-lab-demo/blob/main/qbraid_quantum_jobs.ipynb) to interface with [Amazon Braket supported devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-devices.html). You can add code directly to [`open_challenge.ipynb`](open_challenge.ipynb) or start from scratch in a seperate file. Just make sure that all relevant files are included in your pull request upon submission.
